# Build progress — the milestone record (Week 1 → provenance spine M5)

**This is a STATUS RECORD, not a rule.** It is a dated snapshot of what had shipped when each
milestone closed, moved out of CLAUDE.md on 2026-09-17 so that file carries rules only. Nothing here
tells you what the code must do today — read the code, or the rule sections in CLAUDE.md.

Kept because it answers two questions cheaply: *what was built, in what order, against which spec*,
and *which files a milestone introduced*. The old top-of-file code map is at the bottom, for the
same reason: it is orientation, not truth.

Convention: `docs/archive/README.md`.

## The milestones, as CLAUDE.md recorded them (verbatim)

## Build progress (vs. build-spec 4-week plan)

- **Week 1 — Foundation: DONE.** `/edit` route, Tiptap editor, OPFS autosave (200ms
  debounce), restore-on-refresh, IndexedDB metadata index, hand-rolled PWA
  (`public/manifest.webmanifest` + `public/sw.js`).
- **Week 2 — SCAS variant: DONE (and gone beyond spec).** Per-paragraph stochastic
  re-ranking, red highlighting, Datamuse thesaurus, limit selector, compliance tracking,
  the inline word-cycle UI (Stages A & B done; C & D in progress).
- **Provenance spine M0 — SCAS engine swap: DONE.** Building the v4 spec
  (`inkwave-scroll-v01-provenance-spine-build-spec-v4.md`), which supersedes the old
  Week-3 plan. The Week-2 per-paragraph `ranking.ts` model is replaced by `scas/engine.ts`
  + `scas/state.ts` + `scas/controller.ts`: a rotating seed-derived exclusion set `S_v`
  (local seed in M0; server-held from M3) and the ban-credit/satisfied/immunity state
  machine. `RedHighlightExtension` now *renders* engine state (locked ∪ liveKicks) instead
  of recomputing vocab. Delete a kicked word → it locks (forced kick on retype, suppressed
  from popovers); swap → resolves; verdicts freeze at commit so `S_v` rotation never
  reflows committed text. Unit-tested (`scas/engine.test.ts`) + browser-verified.
- **Provenance spine M1 — snapshots + local hashing: DONE.** `provenance/hash.ts`
  (RFC 8785 JCS + SHA-256 + bundleHash), `provenance/wordNudges.ts` (the nudge emitter),
  `provenance/snapshots.ts` (OPFS append-only store; snapshot on a resolved kick when
  the contentHash changed — typing/pastes never snapshot), `components/ReceiptPanel.tsx`.
  Offline, no network; `ots:unstamped` until M2. Unit-tested (`hash.test.ts`) +
  browser-verified (accrues on resolution, persists across reload).
- **Provenance spine M2 — OpenTimestamps → Bitcoin: DONE.** Each snapshot's bundleHash
  is stamped to Bitcoin via OpenTimestamps: unstamped → pending (seconds) → confirmed
  (hours, upgradeable by anyone). `javascript-opentimestamps` is a Node lib that fights the
  SPA's SSR/prerender bundling (global Buffer, stream-browserify in SSR), so OTS runs in a
  **stateless relay** — `api/ots.mjs` (Vercel) + `api/_ots-core.mjs`, mirrored in dev by a
  vite `configureServer` middleware (see vite.config.ts). This is the spec's sanctioned
  `api/stamp` fallback: it logs nothing and only handles a hash, so verification stays
  independently Bitcoin-anchored. Client wrapper `provenance/ots.ts` POSTs to `/api/ots`;
  the ReceiptPanel shows status + a "check Bitcoin" upgrade. `vercel.json` excludes `/api`
  from the SPA rewrite. Browser-verified to pending.
- **Provenance spine M3 — live-composition signing service: DONE.** A stateless,
  content-free signing service issues a rotating server-held exclusion set S_v and signs
  hash-chained receipts. Server (Node; Vercel functions + dev middleware):
  `api/_provenance-core.mjs` (Ed25519 @noble, seed derivation H(masterSecret,docId,v),
  S_v INDEX sampling → bitmask, signPeriod), `api/session.mjs`, `api/sign.mjs`. Client:
  `provenance/receipts.ts` (verifyReceipt/verifyChain), `provenance/session.ts`
  (SessionRunner). The editor opens a session on doc load, drives the SCAS controller off
  the server's S_v (`controller.useServerSet`), and on the period timer signs the period's
  receipt (content + resolved kicks, hashes only) + rotates the set; receipts persist
  (`scasReceipts`) and fold into snapshot bundles so OTS anchors them. Offline → falls back
  to local S_v (degrades visibly). ReceiptPanel shows the chain + a verify action.
  Real keys come from env (INKWAVE_SIGNING_SK / INKWAVE_MASTER_SECRET / VITE_SIGNING_PK);
  published key at `/.well-known/inkwave-signing-key.json` + committed. 49 tests; live
  loop browser-verified (session → receipts chain → verify ✓).
- **Provenance spine M4 — writer-held storage + export bundle: DONE.**
  `provenance/bundle.ts` builds the self-verifying export bundle (content + snapshots
  with OTS proofs + receipt chain + key ref); the ReceiptPanel "⤓ export bundle" downloads
  it. `storage/folder.ts` (File System Access, Chromium-only) — grant a folder once
  (`showDirectoryPicker`), persist the handle in IndexedDB, re-permission on return, and
  mirror doc + snapshots + bundle into it on every provenance checkpoint ("🗀 save to
  folder"). Non-Chromium falls back to OPFS + the export download. FSA grant needs a real
  user gesture (not headless-testable) — verify manually in Chrome.
- **Provenance spine M5 — open verifier + /verify: DONE.** `src/verify/index.ts` (pure,
  framework-free): verifyBundle = content integrity (recompute contentHash + bundleHash)
  + signed-chain (per-session prevHash + Ed25519, reuses receipts.ts) + kick consistency
  (each in-S kick's lemma is in that period's SIGNED set) + friction score + OTS existence
  tally. Verifies against the INDEPENDENTLY published key (not the bundle's claimed key).
  `routes/Verify.tsx` + `/verify` (prerendered): drop in a bundle → full report, entirely
  client-side, no login. 55 tests (6 verifier interop tests via the real server core);
  round-trip browser-verified (export → /verify ✓; tampered → ✗). HONEST GAP: full "no
  silent dodging" replay needs per-period content diffs (bundle carries period content
  *hashes* only) — kick-consistency + friction are the current conformance signals; deeper
  per-word replay is a planned extension. Next: M6 (paid cadence tier + billing).
- **Week 4 — Glyphs, dashboard, certification: NOT STARTED.** No `glyphList.ts`,
  `ParagraphGlyphExtension`, `GlyphDashboard`, or certification PDF/QR. Per the v4 spec's
  out-of-scope list these are later/Phase-2; the spine (M2–M6) comes first.
